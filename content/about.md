Hello! I am the Owner and sole employee of MYD. I design, create, detail, and sew all makeup bags myself. Every day I create my future. I love being a #girlboss and I don't think I've ever been this passionate about anything in my life!

### Story
<br>
MYD was founded when I (Jess) woke up and realized my 9-5 lackluster call job wasn't fulfilling. I was longing for creativity, desperate to make something....anything! I had tried doing beauty reviews on Instagram, but even that wasn't enough.

I knew I needed to do something big, so I bought a sewing machine and began to teach myself the craft. Once I made my first makeup bag I was beaming from head to toe (even though it had a hole in the side), I thought it was the most imperfect/perfect bag I've laid eyes on. The thrill of this kept me at my sewing machine for weeks practicing and perfecting the art of sewing these bags (i'm still learning!).

I quit my 9-5 and settled for part-time work because this passion that I have for owning my own business is the best feeling of accomplishment I've ever felt! MYD is new, but it is growing, and I am constantly learning and applying knowledge to my brand every day. I hope you enjoy looking at my bags and maybe even fall in love with one yourself! :)
