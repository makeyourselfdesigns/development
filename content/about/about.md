Make Yourself Designs was founded on the idea that every day is a new beginning to Make Yourself into the best version of you possible. Whether it is spending an hour dedicated to self care and organization, keeping your vanity looking cute and on trend, or making your life more effortless with a simple keychain. I strive to make this business as fun, cute and personal as I possibly can. Four years ago when MYD was born, I was bored of working for someone, longing to express my creativity, and desperate to feel more fulfilled. My mothers hobby was always sewing and making clothes for me and my doll; I would follow her to craft shows and watch her sell goods. Reflecting on that inspired me to teach myself how to sew. Each product is handmade and crafted with the absolute highest quality standards, it is something I pride myself on. I carefully test each new idea for durability and practicality. Nothing makes me happier than helping people and producing goods that make their lives easier.

I hope you enjoy browsing my shop!
