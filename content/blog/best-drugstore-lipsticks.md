Shopping the drugstore is not only convenient, but its budget friendly. Especially in this day and age; drugstore makeup brands have been keeping up with makeup trends and really developing products with quality comparable to Sephora brands, and it’s all at our fingertips.

Are you ready to **_make yourself_** over with a new affordable lip? Here are some of my favorite lipsticks the drugstore has to offer that are the best bang for your buck (yeah and some of these are almost one buck!)

#### 1. L’Oreal Paris Pro Matte Liquid Lipstick [9.99 on Ulta.com](https://www.ulta.com/infallible-pro-matte-liquid-lipstick?productId=xlsImpprod16211151#)

The formula goes on smooth, and the applicator has a pointed end to really define your lip shape. I wouldn’t say these dry down completely matte, so they are more comfortable than your average “liquid lipstick”. Available in a variety of bold to nude colors.

#### 2. Maybelline Color Sensational Lipsticks (All Varieties) [5.50 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Maybelline-New-York-Color-Sensational-Lipstick-Barely-Brown/16929086)

The color sensational brand has a couple different varieties including Bold, Matte, Metallics, The Buffs, and Vivids. Each of these lines are amazing in their own respect. I have to say these are by far THE BEST lipsticks at the drugstore. They out perform any tube lipstick at sephora in longevity and color payoff, and they’re 8 bucks!

#### 3. Wet n’ Wild SIlk Finish Lipstick [0.99 at Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/wet-n-wild-silk-finish-lipstick/ID=prod1501219-product)

Yeah..this lipstick is ONE DOLLAR, sound the alarms! I couldn’t believe it either, I just kind of wrote it off as kids play makeup for the longest time...until I tried it out. First of all the formula is silky and smooth and the pigment is rich, and there is no second of all because that’s about it. You basically NEED to try this, you have only quarters to lose!

#### 4. Wet n’ Wild Megalast Liquid Catsuit [4.99 at Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/wet-n-wild-megalast-liquid-catsuit-lipstick/ID=prod6351073-product)

Another WOW product from Wet n’ Wild, this liquid lipstick has an awesome shade range and is the best liquid formula at the drugstore. At only 5 bucks too, you can’t beat it. It lasts a long time on my lips, only reapplying after I eat.

#### 5. NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream[ 6.49 at Target](https://www.target.com/p/nyx-professional-makeup-soft-matte-lip-cream/-/A-14728607)

Not quite a lipstick, and not quite a lip stain but somewhere in between is where this creamy formula falls. Its lightweight formula leaves a wash of color all over your lips that isn’t as opaque as a lipstick. I tend to put these in my purse for those “no-makeup” look days, reapplying often. I love the way they feel on my lips, and they look effortless.

#### 6. Elf Moisturizing Lipstick [3.00 at CVS](https://www.cvs.com/shop/e-l-f-moisturizing-lipstick-prodid-1015214)

My last favorite for the drugstore is this one from elf; I agree with the name being “moisturizing” because it definitely gives my lips some plump, and comes off on the lips with a nice juicy finish. Really great shade range, some bold some muted and definitely worth a try!

These are all really great options for the drugstore, and super convenient to pick up next time you’re running and errand (or letting an errand run you at target). If you’re looking to experiment with some colors, these won’t break the bank and I bet no one will be able to guess they only cost you a few bucks too.
