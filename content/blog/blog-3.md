## How to Travel with Beauty Products

_What to use and how to organize beauty products for traveling_

Going on vacation or just out of town for the weekend can be so relaxing, although it usually includes a good amount of planning(and some stress!) ahead of time. I bet the last thing you want to worry about on your trip is your makeup and beauty products spilling and leaking in your luggage. If you want to know how to prevent this from happening, keep reading because i’m going to show you how to travel efficiently  with your beauty products and look cute while doing so.

## 1. Check the temp when & where you’re going: ![](/uploads/2018/11/30/greece-0751.jpg)

Temperature affects everything, not just your clothing choices but your beauty products too. You might have an idea already of what the climate is like wherever you’re going to. Take a look on a weather app a couple days ahead of time to see if it will be humid or cold. For example: If i'm spending my vacation on the beach (I wish) i'll usually pack minimal makeup, extra SPF, and some frizz ease for my hair in the heat. This will help you plan out what products to bring on your trip and save you some space.

## 2. Use your Carry On Wisely:

There’s nothing worse than when the airplane loses your luggage or it doesn’t make it to your connecting flight and now you have to wait for it. I suggest taking your beauty products that will give you the best minimal look in your carry on so you don’t have to waste money on extra products. Make sure you bring necessary toiletries too! They make almost anything in a wipe form now-a-days so you won't have to worry about meeting any liquid requirements.

## 3. Be Picky

![](/uploads/2018/11/30/94a5e3249a83b9a0d649cd504852c44b.jpg)Be honest with yourself about what you’re actually going to use on your trip. It is SO easy to grab everything on your vanity so that you don’t have to worry. I suggest picking 1 of each of your favorites as far as: foundation, concealer, eye shadow palette, face & contour palette, brow products, and whatever else you need. A good idea is to do a neutral look and bring a lot of different fun lipstick options to change your look up!

## 4. Keep em Separated

Luckily I design and make some awesome bags in my Etsy shop. Most of them are waterproof and wipeable! Check them out here: [https://www.etsy.com/shop/MakeYourselfDesigns?section_id=18858827](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MakeYourselfDesigns?section_id=18858827 "https://www.etsy.com/shop/MakeYourselfDesigns?section_id=18858827")

## 5. ZIPLOC!

![](/uploads/2018/11/30/IMG_1251.png)One of the most important tips above planning, above separating, and finding a location for your products is to get to the root of this cause: leaks and spills. My favorite hack is to simply use a ziploc bags around some repeat offenders or suspects in your beauty products that will leak. A great idea if the bottle is too big is to take it and wrap it over and around the top of your micellar water(for example) and then use a hair tie to secure it. Voila! Now you have extra hair ties AND security (I always need both tbh). If you’re worried about using too much plastic, you can always simply reuse the bags for something else afterwards.
