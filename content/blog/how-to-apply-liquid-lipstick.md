Liquid Lipstick can be scary, it can be intimidating, and it can be challenging even for someone who wears it daily. You want to find that balance between overline and just enough without going too far out of the lines. It can get messy and that’s why i’m here to help.

**First Step: Find the right Liquid Lipstick for you**

Liquid Lipsticks come in a variety of finishes, while most are of the matte variety, there are also satin and glossy. 

For Normal Lips without a lot of texture or lines, I would suggest a basic matte lipstick:

This one is Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick

For Dry Lips with texture

Make sure you read into the type of liquid lip you’re applying so you find one that will work with your lip type.

**Step Two: Use a Lip Scrub 3x a Week (atleast)**

This depends really on how often you wear liquid lips, but if you’re wearing them daily, make sure you’re exfoliating more! No matter which finish you wear, texture is always exaggerated when wearing liquid lipsticks. You can DIY a sugar scrub using 1 part sugar and 1 part coconut oil OR you can purchase the one above at your local [Lush store for 10.95](https://www.lushusa.com/face/lips/bubblegum/03056.html)

**Third Step: Moisturize Your Lips**

Be sure to moisturize your lips daily, this helps not only with the application of liquid lipstick but its also anti-ageing! Yes, those lines on your lips are part hereditary and part wrinkles from lack of moisture. Before I apply a liquid lip I always pat on some chap stick if my lips are feeling extra dry.

My Favorite is the Balm Dotcom from [Glossier for 12.00](https://www.glossier.com/products/balm-dotcom?gclid=CjwKCAjwnLjVBRAdEiwAKSGPI4nk_4XZdLX5UK1tDuFcuvo9pZlAw70QTL_bfivbTqA_P9-8sLTydhoCGcUQAvD_BwE)

**Step Four: Use a Lip Liner**

This one might be the most important; Liquid lipstick has a tendency to run. Meaning that as you apply it, it can seep into the lines around your lips. It also can be streaky, needing 2-3 coats before the pigment is even across your lip. To help solve both problems, line the entire perimeter and fill your lips in completely. My favorite drugstore liner is the [NYX Retractable Liner](https://www.nyxcosmetics.com/retractable-lip-liner/NYX_051.html), pictured above. 

Take a look at the lips below. On the left, looking closely you can see patches of pigment and some seeping into fine lines, that is what you don’t want!! The lip on the right is lined and moisturized.

**Step 5: Take Your Time**

One of the best reasons to choose a liquid lip over regular lipstick is because of the longevity. You want something that is going to go on strong and stay on for a long time without having to re-apply throughout the day. So with that said follow these steps and take your time when you’re ready to apply.
