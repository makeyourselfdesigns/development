Getting ready to go out with friends is one of my **favorite** activities; looking cute, doing my makeup, the whole thing. However, getting ready for work or school? This is one of my _least_ favorite because if you’re like me, you’re constantly checking your clock to make sure you have time for x y and z. If you’re tired of racing out the door, keep reading because I am going to show you some easy things to incorporate into your routine that will help you get ready for work in 30 minutes or less.

###### **1. Set your alarm for a reasonable time**

Are you the type of person to hit snooze a lot? Plan ahead and make sure you give yourself enough time to snooze and to set a final alarm with a different ring tone to let you know it's time to get UP!

Also: sleep with your phone on the other side of the room so you have to get up to snooze

2. **Get your coffee situation ready**

If you make your coffee at home then program your coffee maker! Most of them have a program setting where it will automatically start brewing at whatever time you specify. If you have a keurig set your travel cup next to your coffee maker (make sure its cleaned the night before!) and have your k-cups or pods ready to go.

2. **Outfit Prep the Night Before**

Knowing what you're going to wear is a _serious_ time saver, need I say more? Make time in your night routine to put aside an outfit for the next day and it will save you so much time.

3. **Keep an Everyday Essentials Makeup Bag**

Take note of the makeup that you use routinely every day and put it all together to make it easy to grab while you get ready. It has everything in it so that you can save some serious time getting ready. You can also grab it and take it with you if you're in a serious time crunch.

4. **Shower with Intent**

Okay yeah I admit this one sounds a little funny but seriously- get in and get out! If you like to shower in the morning, make sure you keep it simple and allow the time for it. I recommend showering at night to save time.

5. **Get your purse organized**

Keep your keys and Wallet in the same spot so you can grab and go in the morning. Make Yourself Designs makes Keychain Wallets that hold both!

6. **Grab and Go Breakfast**

This can be a granola bar, oatmeal packet and a travel bowl, a banana. It's really up to you and what you prefer, but have it ready to go. I totally love these overnight oat recipes I find on Pinterest

7. **Just Plan Ahead!** All of these tips and tricks are easy to implement and will get you out of the house in 30 minutes or less if you take the time to plan ahead. A good morning can really help you accomplish more during the day, so set yourself up for success!
